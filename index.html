			Recently I was in need of a house sitter and discovered my options were limited so I decided to fill a void in my community. I am offering house sitting services for the Grand Falls, New Brunswick area and within a 100kms radius. I am willing to travel wherever I am needed outside of area for a fee. I am ecstatic to start this new adventure with you.<br><br>

			While watching your home and taking care of your furchildren, I will love them like they are my own. I will spend all day showering them with affection and follow any instructions you have for their care (if any). I have 25+ years of animal handling. Types of animals I have experience with are dogs, cats, caged rodents, fish, and reptiles.<br>

I will be taking full responsibility for the health and welfare of your children while you are away. The days will be spent with child-focused activities.  I have over 20 years child care experience as well as raising my own children. I have a diploma in Early Childhood Education and up to date First Aid training.<br><br>

			During my time in your home while taking care of the beings you treasure more than anything, I will also provide light housekeeping and yard care if needed.<br><br>
